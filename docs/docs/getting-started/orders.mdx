:::note

This article describes the basics of creating and editing the orders, issuing refunds, changing statuses, and using order timeline. For detailed information, please check [Orders main article](../topics/orders/orders.mdx).

:::

The order is automatically created entity after the customer successfully passes the **[Checkout](../topics/customers/checkout.mdx)**. 

The order contains:
- list of the products
- customer details
- information about the selected shipping method
- order payment details
- additional data (statuses, comments)

If you make sales outside of Unistore and you want to track the movement of all items in stock and have access to these sales in reports, you can [create orders](#create-order) for such sales manually.

## Order statuses
Each order has three independent statuses: 
- Order status
- Payment status
- Fulfillment status

### Order status
Order statuses are:
- Draft
- Active
- Archived

**Draft**. The [manually created](#create-order) order with <Image src="/img/draft-status.png" alt="Draft status" height={22} /> label and at least one product added. Orders in *Draft* status have no payment status. Their status can only be changed to *Active* after order is marked as *Paid*.

**Active**. An order that is in neither *Draft* nor *Archived* status. You can change order status from *Active* to *Archived* and back.

**Archived**. An order that has both payment status and fulfillment status, and which is hidden from the list of orders. Use the [filter](../topics/orders/orders.mdx#filter-orders) by order status to display archived orders. You can change order status from *Active* to *Archived* and back.  

### Payment status
You can change payment status of the order by performing the [actions](#actions) with it. You can [confirm receiving](#change-payment-status-mark-order-as-paid) of the payment for the order, initiate a full or partial [refund](#issue-refund) to the customer, or [cancel the order](#cancel-order) and return all or part of the goods to the stock.

Responses from the payment system are used to automatically change payment statuses. 

The payment statuses are:

- <Image src="/img/pending-status.png" alt="Pending status image" height={22} /> Pending
- <Image src="/img/paid-status.png" alt="Paid status image" height={22} /> Paid
- <Image src="/img/partially-refunded-status.png" alt="Partially refunded status image" height={22} /> Partially refunded
- <Image src="/img/refunded-status.png" alt="Refunded status image" height={22} /> Refunded
- <Image src="/img/canceled-status.png" alt="Canceled status image" height={22} /> Canceled

### Fulfillment status
The fulfillment status shows whether the order has been sent to the customer or not.

The fulfillment statuses are the following:
- <Image src="/img/unfulfilled-status.png" alt="Unfulfilled" height={22} /> Unfulfilled
- <Image src="/img/fulfilled-status.png" alt="Fulfilled" height={22} /> Fulfilled

## Create order

:::note

Manually created orders are not linked to the payment system, so their [payment statuses](#order-statuses) should also be changed manually.

:::

Before you create an order, make sure that the customer and [products](products.mdx#create-your-first-product) for that order already exist. [Create the customer profile manually](customers-gs.mdx#create-customer-profile-manually) if needed.

The order creation window contains two tabs: **General** and **Details**.
