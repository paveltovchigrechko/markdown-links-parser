The product is one of the most important entities in setting up a store.

Create, edit, and delete products in the **Products** section of the admin interface.

You can create up to 100 000 products within one store.

## Create your first product

The product creation window contains two tabs: **General** and **Options**.

Describe the product for the customer in as much detail as possible: its functions, features, and details. In this way, your customer's expectations are more likely to match reality, so they will be satisfied and you will have less product returns.

If your product is not original, but a copy of the brand, this must be stated in the product description.


:::danger WARNING

We can delete products that do not match the description. If there are many such products, we may completely delete the entire store. Please, be honest with your customers.
