## Create store {#create-store}

:::note

You can skip this step and [create the store](account-settings.mdx#create-store) later. To do so, reload the page in your browser. You will be redirected to [your Unistore account](account-settings.mdx).

:::

1. Fill in **Store name**. Your store name must contain 2 - 63 characters. You can use Latin letters, digits, and hyphens
2. Optionally, you can change **Store URL**. By default, your store URL is autogenerated after you fill in **Store name**. We recommend you keep the default URL unless the store with the same URL already exists in Unistore. In such a case, the notification about it will appear

:::tip

You can change the store URL without changing the store name.

:::

3. Select **Create Account** 

After creating the store you will be redirected to [your Unistore account](account-settings.mdx).
