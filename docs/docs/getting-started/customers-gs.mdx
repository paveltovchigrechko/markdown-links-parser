This article describes the basics of the customer creation and management. For detailed information explore [Customers main article](../topics/customers/customers.mdx).

:::

Every time a new customer places an order or signs up in your store, the account for new customer is created as well as a customer profile in the **Customer** section of your admin interface. 

Only the customer himself has access to the customer's account. 
The customer profile is accessed via the admin interface, the customer does not have access to it.

You can invite customers to your store by [creating their profile manually](#create-customer-profile-manually).

Another way to add customers to your store is to import the CSV file with customers data.

## Basics on customer parameters

When you create or edit customers, you can fill in information about them in 4 blocks:
- [Description](#description)
- [Management](#management)
- [Shipping address](#shipping-address)
- [Note](#note)

### Description
In the **Description** block, you can enter the customer's name and contact information. Also, you can add a [note](#note) about the customer.

:::note

**Email** field is required to create customer.

:::

:::note

The data specified in the **Email** and **Phone number** fields should be unique within your store.

:::

### Management

**Tags**.
By assigning tags to customers, you can form groups of them, which you can then easily manage using the filter and the search by tags.

For more detailed information, please explore [full article](../topics/admin-tools/tags.mdx).
<!-- **Collect tax.**  пока не работает, и непонятно, когда вообще начнет-->

**Customer subscribed to marketing emails**.

:::note

By default, when you create a customer manually, this checkbox is not marked. You need to get the customer's consent to receive the mailings.

:::

If the customer agrees to receive mailings, this checkbox is marked and the date of subscription to the mailings is displayed under it. 

Unmark the checkbox to unsubscribe the customer from the marketing mailing list.

### Shipping address

By default, data for **First name**, **Last name** and **Phone number** is copied from the similar fields of the **Description** block.

:::note

All of the **Shipping address** block fields are optional.

:::

A customer can have up to 3 shipping addresses. 

When adding additional shipping addresses, the one that was used on the first order remains the default address.

### Note
Use **Notes** to complete the customer's description with the important information that you need to remember about them.

:::tip 

Your customer notes are only displayed in the admin interface. These notes are not displayed to customers in their accounts.

:::

## Create customer profile manually

When you create a customer profile manually, we send an email to the specified email address with an invitation to join the service.

The customer is invited to change the password and then to log in to the created customer account.

<!-- приглашения пока не проработаны вообще -->

:::tip

Only **Email** field is required to create customer. But if you start filling in fields for address, all of them (except **Company** field) became obligatory.
