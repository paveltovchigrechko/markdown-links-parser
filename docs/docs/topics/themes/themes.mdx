<!-- How to add a theme in library -->

In the themes library, you can:
* [set a theme as active](#set-active-theme)
* [edit a theme](#edit-theme)
<!-- * [preview a theme](#preview-theme) -->
<!-- * [upload your custom theme](#upload-theme) -->
<!-- * [duplicate a theme](#duplicate-theme) -->
<!-- * [delete a theme](#delete-theme) -->

## Set theme as active {#set-active-theme}

The active theme is the one your store website uses at the moment. Your store has only one active theme. 

When you set a new theme as active, your store website changes instantly. You might want to [edit the theme](#edit-theme) before setting it active. Switching themes affects your store website only, all other store features like products, custom pages, navigation menus, and so on remain unaffected.

To set a theme as active:
1. In the theme card, select <Image src="/img/ellipsis-icon.png" alt="Ellipsis icon" width={20} height={20} />
2. Select **Set as Active**
3. In the pop-up window, select **Confirm**


## Edit theme {#edit-theme}

To edit a theme in the website editor, in the theme card, select <Image src="/img/edit-button.png" alt="Edit button" width={20} height={20} />. You can customize a theme using admin interface in page editor or edit theme code directly in code editor. Learn more how you can change and set up a theme in [**Website editor**](../website-editor/website-editor.mdx).

:::note

You can edit any theme available in the library, non-active ones included.
