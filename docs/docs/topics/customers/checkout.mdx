The **Checkout** process is a series of steps a customer must take to complete a purchase on your website.

The **Checkout** process consists of three steps:
- [Contact info](#contact-info)
- [Shipping details](#shipping-details)
- [Payment](#payment)


## Contact info

At this step, the customer provides their contact information: first and last names, email, and phone number. 

There are two ways to make a purchase: 
- Purchase by a [registered customer](#registered-customer) (the customer has to sign up and log in, or just to log in to their previously registered personal account)
- [Quick purchase](#quick-purchase) (no sign-up is required)

###   Registered customer

If only registered users are [allowed to place orders](../store-settings/store-settings.mdx#set-up-main-store-settings) in the store, then at the first step they have to either [log in](#log-in) or [sign up](#sign-up).

:::info

If customer was already authorized when they went from the **Cart** to the checkout, they proceed directly to the second step of **Checkout**: [**Shipping details**](#shipping-details)

:::

#### Log in
1. At **Contact info** step, select **Log in** tab
2. Fill in **Email** and **Password** fields with the data you used for signing up at the store.

:::info

If you forgot your password, select **Forgot password?** to [reset](personal-account.mdx#reset-password) it.

:::

3. Select **Next** to proceed to **[Shipping details](#shipping-details)** step

#### Sign up
1. At **Contact info** step, select **Sign up** tab
2. Provide first and last names, and email
3. Create a password in **Password** field

:::note Password requirements

- 7+ characters
- digit
- special symbol
- uppercase letter

:::

4. Select **Next** to proceed to the next step

### Quick purchase

1. At **Contact info** step, select **Quick purchase** tab
2. Provide first and last names, and email
3. Select **Next** to proceed to the next step

## Shipping details

At this step, the customer provides the shipping address and the information about the recipient, and chooses a convenient [delivery option](../store-settings/delivery-options.mdx).

:::caution

If no delivery option is added to the [region](../store-settings/delivery-options.mdx#create-region) selected by the customer, the customer is not able to make the purchase.

:::

Delivery options are displayed when the customer has selected a shipping address.

### Authorized customer

If the customer has not added any address to their personal account, the **Shipping details** page / tab displays fields to add the shipping address and recipient information. 

If the customer has at least one address added to their [personal account](personal-account.mdx), they will have **My addresses** and **New address** tabs at the **Shipping details** step.

#### My addresses

The **My Addresses** tab displays all the addresses previously added by the customer to their personal account. The first of the added addresses is marked as default. If the customer is comfortable with the delivery to the default address, and they do not make any changes, the customer can select delivery option and move on to the next step of the **Checkout**: **[Payments](#payment)**.

Also, on the **My Addresses** tab, the customer can select a different shipping address, make changes to existing addresses, or delete unnecessary ones.

Managing delivery addresses is the same as in the personal cabinet and is described in the relevant [article](personal-account.mdx#shipping-address-management).

#### New address

The address added on this tab is used only for the current order and is not saved in the **Shipping addresses** of the personal account.

:::info

The **New address** tab is always active, even if the customer has all three possible addresses added.

:::

To proceed to the [next step](#payment), the customer needs to provide recipient's information and shipping details, and then select **Next**.

### Quick purchase

1. Provide recipient's information and shipping details
2. Select the radio button for a suitable delivery option
3. Select **Next**
