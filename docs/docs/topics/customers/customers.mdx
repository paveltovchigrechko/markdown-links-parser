Every time a new customer signs up in your store, the account for new customer is created as well as a customer profile in the **Customer** section of your admin interface. If the customer chooses a **Quick purchase**, only the customer profile is created.

Only the customer himself has access to the customer's account. 
The customer profile is accessed via the admin interface, the customer does not have access to it.

You can invite customers to your store by [creating their profiles manually](#create-customer-profile-manually).

Another way to add customers to your store is to import the CSV file with customers data.
<!-- add link to import -->
<!-- Customer account contains:
- contact information
- shipping address
- all of his order's details
- payment information
- information about consent to receive promotional emails. -->

In the **Customers** section you can:
- view a list of all customers and find customers using the search bar (explore [Listing](#listing-customers))
- [sort](#sort-customers) and [filter](#filter-customers) the customers
- manually [create customer profile](#create-customer-profile-manually)
- check and [edit customer profile](#edit-customer): check and update information, add tags, notes for customers, comments on their orders
<!-- - [import](#import-customers) and [export](#export-customers) data about customer profiles -->
- [download the full customer details](#customer-data) in CSV file (contact information and all their orders details) or delete it
- [delete customer](#delete-customer)

:::tip

Also, you can go from a customer's profile to the **Orders** section to view all of that customer's orders and, if necessary, create a new one.

:::note

**Email** field is required to create customer.

:::

:::note

The data specified in the **Email** and **Phone number** fields should be unique within your store.

:::

### Management

**Tags**.
By assigning tags to customers, you can form groups of them, which you can then easily manage using the filter and the search by tags.

<!-- пока это так не работает. если к запуску 1 мерчанта не будет работать, переформулировать -->

:::note

You can use Latin letters, digits, hyphens, lower underscores, and commas to create a tag.

:::

You can use up to 250 tags for one customer.

For more detailed information, explore [full article](../admin-tools/tags.mdx).
<!-- **Collect tax.**  пока не работает, и непонятно, когда вообще начнет-->

**Customer subscribed to marketing emails**.
Using a marketing mailing list, you can send customers news about your store, notify them about new products, promotions, sales.

If the customer agrees to receive mailings, this checkbox is marked and the date of subscription to the mailings is displayed under it. 

:::note

By default, when you create a customer manually, this checkbox is not marked. You need to get the customer's consent to receive the mailings.

:::

Unmark the checkbox to manually unsubscribe the customer from the marketing mailing list.

<!-- ссылка на создание маркетинговых рассылок -->

### Shipping address

By default, data for **First name**, **Last name** and **Phone number** is copied from the similar fields of the **[Description](#description)** block.

The shipping address that the customer specifies in their first order is saved as the default address.

A customer can have up to 3 shipping addresses.

All information related to the customer's profile is displayed on the page in three tabs:

#### Customer data

Every customer [has the right](../privacy/GDPR/gdpr.mdx) to request a copy of their data or to demand the permanent deletion of their personal information (anonymization) retained in your store.

Regarding access to information or the anonymization of personal data, the customer will reach you using the contact information that you provide in the Terms of Use of your store.

:::info

Learn more about [how to comply](../privacy/GDPR/gdpr-compliance.mdx) with General Data Protection Regulation.

:::

This block displays the **Request** and **Delete** buttons.
<!-- Check the labels of the buttons after task https://jira.cardpay.com/browse/ECOM-4824 is finished -->

:::info

Usually it takes us up to 7 days for us to fulfill a request.

:::

##### Delete customer data
<!-- Information about difference is still checked by Vika -->
[Deleting a customer](#delete-customer) and anonymizing their data are not the same thing. When a customer is deleted, their personal account  is completely deleted, as well as information about orders from it. All orders in the admin panel are saved, but the customer's personal data disappears from them.

When we anonymize customer data, the customer personal account continues to exist. The customer can find their orders in their personal account. All information about orders is saved in **Orders** section of the admin panel, but instead of personal data, encrypted information is displayed.

When you select **Delete** button, a request to anonymize customer data is sent to Unistore.

:::info

Usually it takes us up to 7 days for us to fulfill a request. Also keep in mind that you must respond to a customer within 14-30 days, depending on their jurisdiction.

:::

After we have fulfilled the request for data anonymization, you will receive an email notification that the customer's personal data has been deleted. You can then notify the user.

##### Request data

When you select **Request** button, a request to get a file with information about this customer is sent to Unistore. 

After we fulfill the request to obtain the file with the customer's data, you will receive this file in CSV format to your email. Then you can send the file to the customer.


<!-- ### Orders
<!-- макетов нет, на фронте нет -->

<!-- ### Timeline
<!-- макетов нет, на фронте нет -->
<!-- There are three types of messages displayed on this tab:
- records about changes in the customer's profile
- records about changes in the customer's order statuses
- comments

For each record, the time when it was added to the timeline is displayed. The timeline records are displayed by the day when the events occurred.

<!-- #### Comments
You can leave comments about the customers, their orders and other activities in the store. 

:::note

Comments are displayed only in the admin interface. The customers cannot see them in their customer accounts.

:::

<!-- A **Comment** block can consist of the following elements:
- text input field of up to 5000 characters
- emoji
- tag (to mention another employee of the store)
- link to the product, order or customer page 

 <!-- также упоминается ссылка на страницу любого пользователя, у которого есть доступ к магазину. Пока неочевидно, что это. На макетах отсутствует-->
 
<!-- - downloaded file up to 5mb size  -->
