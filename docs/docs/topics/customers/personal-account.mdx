This article describes customer registration and authorization, as well as the actions that the customer can perform in their personal store account.

:::info

You can use all the step-by-step instructions in this article for technical support: copy the instructions and send them to the customer. All the admonitions within the instructions are also addressed to customers.

Purchases in your store are available both to registered and unregistered customers.<!-- (if you have [allowed](../store-settings/store-settings.mdx#set-up-main-store-settings) such purchases in the store settings). -->

To make a quick purchase without signing up at your store, your customers have to provide [contact information](checkout.mdx#contact-info) and specify the [shipping address](checkout.mdx#shipping-details) at the **[Checkout](checkout.mdx)**.

Registering in the store gives the customer an opportunity to save contact information in the personal account and add up to three shipping addresses. It allows the customer to spend less time on placing an order. Also, having a personal account allows the customer to see the list and the payment and fulfillment statuses of all their orders.
