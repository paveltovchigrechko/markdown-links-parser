## Introduction

<Image src="/img/website-structure.png" alt="Website content hierarchy" block bordered rounded />

The store website content has a hierarchy:
1. Pages
2. Sections
3. Blocks

Generally, the website contains pages of different types (for example, a product page, a home page, a checkout page). Each page divides into sections. A section is a single element that can contain a small visual block. For example, there can be several small product images and descriptions on the home page. While one product image with a description is a block, the whole set is a section.

The website theme defines the page types, the available sections, and the settings. A website theme is a set of Liquid files.

The website editor provides you with a set of instruments to customize the appearance of your store website.

You can use the following website editor instruments:
1. **[Page editor](page-editor/page-editor.mdx)**. It allows setting up the website pages and working with page sections
2. **[Navigation](navigation.mdx)**. It allows creating and editing of the navigation menus. You can embed the navigation menu into the website section using **Page editor** or **Code editor**
3. **[Theme settings](theme-settings.mdx)**. It contains the default theme settings and allows changing the website graphic and stylistic appearance
4. **[Code editor](code-editor.mdx)**. It allows advanced website customizing via editing its theme files

The **Page editor** and **Theme settings** instruments are designed for unexperienced users. They offer more user-friendly approach to website customizing.

The **Code editor** and **Navigation** instruments allow deeper and tuned website customization but require experience with website building and programming knowledge.
