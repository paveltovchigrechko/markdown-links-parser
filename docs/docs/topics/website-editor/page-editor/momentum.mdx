## Header {#header}

:::info

In Momentum, the header section settings apply to all pages. Therefore, once you set up the header for one page (for example, for the home page), other pages (product and collection pages) will render the header with the same settings.

:::

The **Header** is the topmost section on the page.

The **Header** section contains [**Logo**](#logo), [**Links**](#links), and [**Announcement bar**](#announcement-bar) settings.

### Logo {#logo}

The **Logo** settings define the image that is rendered on the left side of the header.

**Image**. You can add the logo image in three ways:
* Select the frame and choose the file in the file explorer
* Drag and drop the image file on the frame
* Select **Image gallery**, select the image, and choose **Select**. To learn more about image gallery, refer to [**Media gallery** article](../../admin-tools/media-gallery.mdx)
    
**Logo name**. This text appears if the header has no logo image or the logo image cannot be rendered for some reason.

### Links {#links}

### Announcement bar {#announcement-bar}

The **Announcement bar** settings define the topmost bar that appears above the header. You can use this bar to bring the attention of your customers to an announcement.

**Show announcement**. Mark the checkbox to display the announcement bar in the header.

**Home page only**. Mark the checkbox to restrict the announcement bar to the home page only. If not marked, the announcement bar appears on all website pages.
