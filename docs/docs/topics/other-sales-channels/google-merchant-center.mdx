:::info

Check [Google documentation](https://support.google.com/merchants) if you have any troubles with your account or feed in Google Merchant Center (GMC). We also suggest reading [Onboarding Guide](https://support.google.com/merchants/topic/3163841?hl=en&ref_topic=7259123) by Google Merchant Center Help, if you are new to this service.

:::

Users can find products added to the GMC feed using: 
- Google search
- **Google shopping** tab on a Google search engine results page
- **Images** tab on a Google search engine results page (if your product has at least one image added to the [Media gallery](../admin-tools/media-gallery.mdx))
- YouTube
- Google Assistant 

## Google requirements to store
Google can check your store for some basic requirements and stop displaying your products on the Google platform if these requirements are not met.

You need to have:

<!-- - store website in [_Published_ status](../store-settings/store-settings.mdx#set-up-website-publishing-status) -->
- [Payment provider](../store-settings/payments/payments.mdx) connected
- Credible contact information specified on the store contact page (at least, email address and phone number)
- Clear refund policy

:::tip

Add contact information and refund policy using [**Custom pages**](../custom-pages/custom-pages.mdx).
