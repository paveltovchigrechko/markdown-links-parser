:::info Before you start

You need to have an account of the platform you want to use as sales channel. Also, you need to have [products](../products/products.mdx) in *Active* [status](../products/products.mdx#status) in your store.

:::

Your store is your main sales channel on the Unistore platform. However, you can connect additional sales channels to sell products from your store at Unistore:

- [Google Merchant Center](google-merchant-center.mdx)
- [Meta Commerce Manager](meta-commerce-manager.mdx)
- [TikTok Catalog Manager](tiktok-catalog-manager.mdx)
 <!-- - Telegram -->
 
Connecting sales channels allows you to offer your store's products on three additional platforms. You do not have to spend time creating products and updating information about them on each platform separately. 

You can also monitor in Unistore [reports](../reports/sales.mdx) on all sales made by customers that came from other sales channels.

For each platform, you can choose a different set of products that are better suited to them.

The list of products you want to sell on the platform is written to a file called a *feed*. 

:::info

If there are no products in the feed, none of your products are displayed on the platform.

:::

All the [parameters](../products/products.mdx#product-parameters) of the products that you have specified for them are inside this feed, the [media](../products/products.mdx#media) is also taken into account. Information about your store's products is updated in a feed automatically. Keep in mind that the feed is updated according to the schedule you set on the platform.

:::info

Platforms may ignore some products in the feed if the products have no images added or parameters are not filled in:

- SKU / ID (also, fill it in for each variant of the product)
- Barcode / ISBN, UPC, GTIN, etc.
- Description
- Vendor
- Current quantity of product in stock

:::

1. Register on sales channel platform
