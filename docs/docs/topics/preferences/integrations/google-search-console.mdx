## What is Google Search Console? {#about}

Google Search Console is a service that helps you monitor, maintain, and troubleshoot how your website appears in Google Search results. You do not have to sign up for Google Search Console to be included in Google Search results, but Google Search Console helps you understand and improve how Google sees your website.

:::info

For further information, you can refer to the [Google Search Console documentation](https://support.google.com/webmasters/).

:::

<!-- :::caution -->

<!-- If you [publish your website with password](../../store-settings/store-settings.mdx#set-up-website-publishing-status), the Googlebot cannot access and crawl your website. As a result, Google Search Console cannot generate any report or data for your website. -->

<!-- ::: -->
To use Google Search Console, you need to [set up your account](#setup) and [verify your website ownership](#verify). 

## Set up Google Search Console {#setup}

You need to have a Google account to use Google Search Console. You can [create a new account](https://accounts.google.com/) or use an existing one. If you have a separate Google account for your store, we recommend using it for Google Search Console.

To set up Google Search Console:
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/)
2. Optionally, if you already have Google Search Console properties, [add a new website property](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/34592/)
3. Whether you create your first property or add a new one, we recommend using **URL prefix** property. Fill in your [active store domain](../../store-settings/domains.mdx) with the protocol prefix. For example: <Code>https://mystore.yourunistore.com</Code><p>Otherwise, if you use your own [domain](../../store-settings/domains.mdx), you can select **Domain** property. Note that you have to use domain name verification in this case. Find more about this verification method in [Google documentation](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080#domain_name_verification)</p>
4. Select **Continue**

:::info

If you previously enabled [Google Tag Manager](google-tag-manager.mdx) or [Google Analytics](google-analytics.mdx) integration with the same Google account, your website ownership will be auto-verified for **URL prefix** property. Skip the next paragraph in this case.

## Verify your website ownership {#verify}

Google Search Console supports several different verification methods. You can learn more about them in [Google Search Console documentation](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080).

<!-- :::info -->

<!-- Most verification methods require your website to be accessible to non-logged users. It means you have to [publish your website without password](../../store-settings/store-settings.mdx#set-up-website-publishing-status) first. -->

<!-- ::: -->

We recommend verifying with one of the methods:
* Google Analytics. You can connect [Google Analytics integration](google-analytics.mdx) to auto-verify your website ownership
* Google Tag Manager. You can connect [Google Tag Manager integration](google-tag-manager.mdx) to auto-verify your website ownership 
* HTML tag 

To verify your website ownership with the HTML tag:
1. In your Google Search Console account, find and copy the HTML tag needed for the verification. Refer to [Google documentation](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080#meta_tag_verification) for details
2. Go to your Unistore admin interface
3. In the sidebar, select **Website editor**
4. In the sidebar, select **Code editor**
5. In the sidebar, select **Layout** folder
6. Open <Code>theme.liquid</Code> file (for Unistore default theme)

:::tip

If you use a theme not developed by Unistore, refer to the theme documentation or contact the developer to find the main file for the theme. 

:::

7. In the code workspace, find the closing `</head>` tag
8. Paste the HTML tag from Google Search Console <b>before</b> the closing `</head>` tag. Your code should look similar to: 
```
...
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="your-verification-code" />
</head>
```
9. Select **Save**
10. In Google Search Console, complete the verification (find more details in [Google Search Console documentation](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080#meta_tag_verification))

If you use your own [domain](../../store-settings/domains.mdx), you can use [domain name verification](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080#domain_name_verification). Note that if you selected a **Domain** property when [setting up Google Search Console account](#setup), you must use this method.

:::info

After the verification, Google Search Console can take up to 48 hours to start displaying reports.
