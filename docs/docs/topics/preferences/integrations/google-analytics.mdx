## What is Google Analytics? {#about}

:::info

Google has two products known as analytical tools. Google Universal Analytics (UA) is a classic [platform that is planned to stop functioning on July 1, 2023](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528/). [Google Analytics 4 or GA4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681/) is a new generation solution that replaces UA as the default Google analytic system. 

This article refers to Google Analytics 4. If you already use Universal Analytics, we recommend you consider [switching to GA4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10759417/).

## Set up Google Analytics {#setup}

You need to have a Google account to create a Google Analytics account. You can [create a new Google account](https://accounts.google.com/) or use an existing one. If you have a separate Google account for your store, we recommend using it for Google Analytics.

To set up Google Analytics:
1. Log into your Google account
2. [Create Google Analytics account](https://analytics.google.com/) or [add a new account to an existing one](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009694/)

:::tip

If you decide to use a Google Analytics account with existing properties, we recommend [creating a new property](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153#property) for your website.

:::

3. [Create a data stream](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153#stream). Make sure you select **Web** as a stream platform. Use your [active store domain](../../store-settings/domains.mdx) for the stream URL
4. In data stream settings, find [Measurement ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12270356/) and copy it
5. Use **Measurement ID** to [connect Google Analytics integration](integrations.mdx#connect) to your store

:::info

Google Analytics can take up to 48 hours to start displaying reports.

## Configure Google Analytics {#configure}

After you enable the integration, you may want to configure Google Analytics:

## Google Analytics limitations {#limits}

While Google Analytics is a great tool to explore your website statistics and analyze your customers' behavior, it still has some limitations when it comes to data interpretation. This paragraph provides a brief description of some of them to keep in mind while working with Google Analytics.

###  Data limits

Google Analytics has the data limits:
1. [Hits limits](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/limits-quotas/). Note that if you reach the hit limit, any excess hits may not be processed. As a result, your website data may be incomplete
2. [Configuration limits](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12229528/)
3. [Event collection limits](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9267744/)

### AD blockers

Google Analytics uses JavaScript code to track your website visitors. This mechanism has limitations that can prevent collecting some data. If some visitors have AD blockers, Google Analytics cannot track their data. It impacts the statistics for sessions, pageviews, clicks, and sometimes your order data. 

<!-- ### Orders outside website -->
<!-- Link to other sales channels -->
<!-- Google Analytics works with your store website only. If you enable other sales channels for your store, this data is not included in Google Analytics reports.  -->

### Data sampling

Sometimes Google Analytics [samples the data](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2637192/) on the reports. Since the sampling is always an estimation, it may lead to inaccurate data portrait. 

To avoid it, you can [adjust the data sampling](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1733979/) in your reports.
