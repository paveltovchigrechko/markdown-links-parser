## What is Google Tag Manager? {#about}

Google Tag Manager is a tool that allows you to manage and deploy marketing tags (code snippets or tracking pixels) on your website. It allows tags management through web graphic interface, so you do not need to modify the website code directly.

Here is a simple example of how Google Tag Manager works. You choose tags to insert into your website and triggers that fire tags. Google Tag Manager embeds these tags into your website code and matches them to the corresponding triggers. Tags tell Google Tag Manager what to do when a trigger fires them. A trigger can be a click on a certain area on your website, scrolling, or form submission.

When a customer on your website makes an action connected with a trigger, it fires the corresponding tag. Normally, a tag collects data about a certain event and sends it to Google Tag Manager, which sends it further to a service connected with the tag (for example, Google Analytics). 

Note that Google Tag Manager only stores and manages tags and their triggers, not the website data. To work with the collected data, you need to use the service connected with the tag.
