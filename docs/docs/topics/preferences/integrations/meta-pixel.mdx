## What is Meta pixel? {#about}
<!-- Does it make sense to use Meta pixel without Meta Commerce Manager? Looks like, yes, one can use it without Meta sales channel -->
Meta pixel is a JavaScript code snippet that you can use to track the activity of Facebook ad-driven visitors on your website. It uses Facebook cookies to match your website visitors to their Facebook accounts. Tracked events and conversions for matched visitors appear in [Facebook Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager/).
