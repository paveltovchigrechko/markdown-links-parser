## Meta tags

[Title](on-page-seo.mdx#meta-title-tag) and [description](on-page-seo.mdx#meta-description-tag) meta tags are titles and summaries of the links that appear on a search engine results page (SERP). They help people and search engines understand what a particular web page is about. In this section, you configure meta tags for the homepage of your store.
To know more about meta tags, explore the article about [search engine optimization](on-page-seo.mdx#meta-tags).

After filling in the title and description fields, check in the preview below how the search snippet of store homepage will look on the [search engine results page](what-is-seo.mdx#search-engine-results-page) and select **Save**.

## Link preview

Links with an image attract more attention, so they may help you to increase your brand's recognition.

You can customize how the link to your store will look if someone shares it on social networks or messengers.

The title and description of the shared link will be the same as in the page [meta tags](#meta-tags).

[Add](#add-link-image) an image related to your brand: it could be your brand's logo or the images of the products you offer.

:::caution

If only a favicon is uploaded, it will be used for the [Apple touch icon](#apple-touch-icon) and [Windows 10 icon](#windows-10-icon).

If the favicon is not uploaded, your customers see the white square instead of all icons. The lack of an icon can make it difficult for them to find the tab of your store in the browser and your website's icon on their device screens.
