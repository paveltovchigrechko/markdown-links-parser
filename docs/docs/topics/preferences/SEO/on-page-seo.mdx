This article describes the basics of promoting your store pages in search engines. Here you can find tips on creating titles, writing descriptions, adding videos and images, and creating meta tags for your pages.

:::

There are a lot of pages in your store that may need promotion. Pages cannot be promoted with the same content and meta tags, each page must be unique. For effective promotion, your content should be high-quality, original, and relevant to the user's query.

For productive On-Page optimization, your store pages should have:

- Carefully selected [keywords](#keywords)
- Unique [meta tags](#meta-tags) (title and description)
- Exclusive [texts](#texts) (accurate, informative, and appealing product descriptions)
- [SEO-friendly URLs](#seo-friendly-urls)
- Optimized [media files](#media-optimization)
<!-- - [Social sharing buttons](#social-sharing-buttons) -->

## Keywords
Keywords are the words and phrases that your target audience uses in a search query to find your product. Put the time and effort into your keyword research, and it may change your business.

To find the best keywords for your products you need to make strategic keyword research based on answering questions:

- What are your business goals?
- Who are your customers? 
- What can they search to find it on your website? What is their intent?
- Can your customers use any special terms or slang to search your product?
- Why do they need your product? What problem can they solve with it? How will they benefit from using your product in particular?
- Which keywords do your competitors use?

Be sure to check "People also ask", "Related searches", and autocomplete suggestions in Google for your keywords. You may get some fresh ideas.

### Keyword types

**Primary keywords**.
Think about your product. What are the first nouns that come to your mind? Which main words and phrases people can use to search your product? These would be your primary keywords.
These keywords have high search volumes. The problem with these words is that they are open to interpretation and get a lower conversion rate than words of another type.

**Secondary keywords**. They can give strength to your primary keywords and boost your SEO strategy. Try to find synonyms for your primary keywords. Are there any words that can help determine the user's intent? Which words can clarify and narrow down their search? All these words would be your secondary keywords.

**Long-tail keywords**. Keywords can be broad and far-reaching (such words are usually called "head keywords"), or they can be a more specific combination of several terms - such words are often called "long-tail keywords". These keywords are responsible for around 70% of all searches. Use your primary and secondary keywords with [modifiers](#modifiers) to create long-tail keywords. 

These keywords convert at a much higher rate, they usually deliver more sales with much less traffic.

### Modifiers
Modifiers are prefix and suffix words that people add to your primary keywords to get a more accurate query. You can use separate modifiers for more general queries or combine them to create long-tail keyword phrases.

There are different types of modifiers, that you can use for your store's SEO.


| Modifier type   | Modifiers                                                                                                |
| ----------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Intent          | Buy, deal, discount, shipping, sale, clearance, coupon, offers, best price, promo code, best value       |
| Geography       | Country and city names: Paris, London, Toronto, near me                                                  |
| Adjective       | Best, top, cheap, coolest, hot, latest, popular, eco-friendly, natural, weatherproof, lightweight        |
| Season          | Season and holiday names: winter, summer, for St. Valentine's Day, for Christmas                         |
| Color and style | Colors, body types, brand names, designers, specific quantities (weights, sizes)                         |
| Product specific| SKU (GTIN, ISBN), model and version numbers, year of creation, materials, prices, kid or animal friendly |
| Gender          | Men's, women's, unisex, for him, for her                                                                 |
| Age             | Teen, kids, for children, for adults                                                                     |

### Where to use keywords

Here is where we highly recommend adding keywords:
- Product / collection name
- [Meta tags](#meta-tags)
- Product / collection [description](#texts)
- Image [alt text](#alt-text)
- [URL](#seo-friendly-urls)

### Keyword cannibalization

Keyword cannibalization means that your store has different products that can be ranked for the same keywords. Either because the products are too similar, or because you have optimized them for the same keywords. If you optimize products for similar search terms, they take away each other's chances of ranking. Thus, you confuse search engines in pointing which page is more important.

:::tip

Try to select keywords carefully so that you do not have the same set of keywords for different pages.

:::

## Meta tags

Meta tags are the HTML code pieces of your website's pages that help search engines understand what your web pages are about and give a first impression of it to your prospects.

The main meta tags, that quickly show the information about pages in your store to both people and search engines, are the title and description tags. 
Together they make up a search snippet.

###  Meta title tag

Titles appear:
 -  On the browser tabs
 -  As clickable links on the SERP
 -  In the links to your web page shared on social media and instant messengers

Title tags are very important and help in describing what content the user will find on that page. 

Note that meta title and the web page title are not the same thing. When people get to your page by the meta title (link in the SERP), they can see the real title of the web page, which is usually the name of your product or collection.

Meta title should not be just the name of your store, product, or collection, because the name alone probably does not give your potential customers an understanding of what is this page about and how does it help them.

:::info

If the title field is empty, the search engines use your store's name instead, which may not be informative enough for users.

:::

###  Meta description tag

Meta description appears below the title in the SERP and in the shared link in social networks and messengers.

A meta description gives the information about your page to user.

Although search engines do not use meta descriptions when ranking, creating good meta descriptions can serve you well: search engines use the click-through rate (CTR) to decide how good your result is. If more people choose your result, search engines define it as good one and, according to your position, move you up in the rankings. This is why meta description optimization is so important.

:::info

If the description field is empty, the search engines use random text from your website.

:::

### How to write good meta tags?

Here are some recommendations on how to write the good SEO title and description:

**Write for people.** People are your audience. Talk with them in their language. They are the ones who decide whether your title and description fit their query, whether you solve their problem, whether to follow the link or not. It is very important for the tags to be understandable to people and easy to read as a sentence.

**Make unique meta tags.** Your store is unique, so should be your meta tags for each page of your website. If a user's query brings up more than one result with the same meta tags, it looks very confusing. Note that in this case the user's choice may not be in your favor.

**Use keywords and modifiers.** 
A search query consists of main [keywords](#keywords) and their [modifiers](#modifiers). Do a thorough analysis of keywords and possible modifiers to get the best results. 

:::tip

The most important keywords should be first in your meta tags, and the least important should be the last.

:::

Do not overload the tags with keywords and their synonyms.

**Keep the right length.** The best length for the SEO title is 50-60 characters, for description, the best length is 155-160 characters, including spaces. Use the length of your tags as much as possible to tell your users key information. 
Remember that titles longer than 69 characters and descriptions longer than 160 characters may be truncated by Google to the right length. So, if you do not want to lose the important meanings in your tags, meet the length requirements. For the same reason, it is not recommended to place keywords at the end of the meta tags.

:::caution

Avoid using double quotation marks in your meta description. Otherwise, your text will be truncated by Google from the first double quote.

:::

**Be precise.** As you are limited by the number of characters, try to make the most accurate title and description that meet the needs of your potential customers.

## Texts
The main texts in your store are the descriptions for your products.

Well-written descriptions, attractive [images](#images), and product [videos](#videos) serve as a sales consultant for your store. If there is enough information and they can answer possible questions about the product, customers will not have to write to you and ask. In addition, there is less chance that customers will be annoyed by the lack of information and leave your store.

### If you are starting writing

Before you begin creating product descriptions, you need to know:
- Who your target audience is (their gender, age, social status, location)
- Why they might be looking for your product?
- Do your products help avoid pain and discomfort, or bring pleasure to your customers?
- Why should they choose your product?
- What words they might use in search engines to find it?

If you have done a [keyword](#keywords) research, you already know the answers to these questions.  

Another thing you need to do before you start writing is to define the voice of your brand, which you will always use to speak to your customers. 
Imagine a sales consultant talking to your customers. What is their speech like? What words do they use to talk to your customers? Are they serious and formal, or do they talk as if the customers were their old friends? 

Address your reader as "you" and write as if you were talking to them in person.

Be sure to use this voice for every piece of text in your store: not only for product descriptions but also for custom pages, for example.

### How to write product descriptions?

Here are a few recommendations on how to write a strong product description:

**Write in plain language.** The wording of your texts should be as simple as possible, given the specifics of your products. Keep in mind that your texts should be understandable to those people who are your target audience. These people may have different levels of education and knowledge of the language you are writing in. Make it easy for them to read.

**Focus on customer.** Focus not on a dry listing of product features, but on your potential customers: 
What results can they achieve if they have your product?
What problem does buying your product solve for the customer?
How can they improve their lives with your product?

:::note

This does not mean that you should completely avoid technical specifications in the product description. Just try to add the benefits to the customer of owning your product.

:::

If the grammar of your language has a tense category, try to write product descriptions in the present or future tense. This gives your prospects the opportunity to mentally become the owner of your product and appreciate all its benefits. 

**Assume customer questions.** Think in advance what questions a customer may ask you about a product? What information is the customer missing?

**Use [keywords](#keywords) and [modifiers](#modifiers).** Remember, however, that the description should not be overloaded with keywords. It should be easy and comfortable for the customer to read your text.

**Improve readability.** Users no longer read entire texts, but scan them with their eyes, picking out the information they want. Make the text easy to scan: break it up into paragraphs, use bullet lists and put some important information in bold.

:::tip

Be sure to use spellchecker. Readers have much less trust in a product if there are mistakes in its description.

:::
### What you definitely need to avoid

- Leaving a product with no description at all or a description so short and uninformative that the customer will not want to contact you to get all the missing information
- Copying product descriptions from your competitors 
- Attaching a screenshot of the description from the product manufacturer to the product [images](#images), or copying a manufacturer's full text into the product description section
- Giving a large amount of technical details about the product without turning it into a benefit for the potential customer
- Putting into description an unreadable text ("wall of text" from which it is impossible to highlight what is important to the customer). Your prospects may have no motivation to struggle through such a difficult-to-understand text

### Product description quick guide

To figure out how to write product descriptions, you can start with our quick guide:
- Use a catchy headline. It should be descriptive and should contain your [primary keywords](#keywords) (but not overloaded by them)
- State the problem and find a [solution](#if-you-are-starting-writing) with your product 
- Add a paragraph about customer benefits
- Make a bullet list of the important features of the product for the customer

## Media optimization

### Images

It is hard to overestimate the importance of images on a product page. Product images help attract customers, tell them more details about your products that they may not understand from the description, and encourage your customers to spend more time on your site. 
Images should be informative and a pleasure to look at: bright, with clean and undistorted colors.
Customers now expect to see more than one image per product. They want to see the product from different angles and in use, ideally in photo and [video](#videos) format.

When thinking about image optimization, consider image format, file naming, image size, and image file size, work out the alt text for each image, and check for copyright issues if you are using someone else's images.

#### Format

It is important to save images in a format that search engines can index. At Unistore, we support images in PNG, JPEG, and JPG formats. You can save your files in these formats in most image editors or use converter tools.

Since JPG and JPEG are two identical file extensions that refer to the same digital image format, only one question remains: what is the difference between JPG and PNG formats?

**JPG**. Images of good quality that do not take up much space in terms of file size. However, these are lossy images, which means that you will permanently lose some of the small details of the image. JPG is definitely the preferred image format for online stores because, due to the file size, it does not take much time to load the images, and the website pages load faster without making your customer wait.

**PNG**. High-quality images with a large file size. It can only be used when you do not want to lose any detail of the image.


#### Size

Note that image size and image file size are two different things. You can find the file size and image size requirements when you upload your images.

#### Copyright

No matter what image files you decide to use, make sure there are no copyright issues. Every image, no matter where you found it, is copyrighted as soon as it is created.

If you use stock photos, be sure to pay any necessary royalties and properly identify the authorship. Images with trademarks or logos can also be tricky: check the owner's legal requirements to make sure you can meet them.

#### File name

The file name is a very brief description of the image.
Search engines read image file names and use them to understand what the image is about and how relevant it is to the user's query. If you name your images properly, you can increase your keyword density and your chances of ranking. 

Name your images in all small letters with hyphens in between and leave no spaces. File names should be short and to the point, and include your primary [keywords](#keywords).

#### Alt text

Alt text is an attribute of an image that is shown to people who, for some reason, cannot see the image. Alt text describes the information or function conveyed by the image. 
This is very important so that everyone can understand the content of your images, so it is highly recommended for you to write alt text for every product end collection image.

Why do your product images need alt text?

- Visually impaired people use screen readers to read page content, and they need alt text to get information about the images.
- Mobile Internet users with slow internet connection can turn off images if these images have alt text. Also, it is helpful when the user is on roaming.
- Images with alt text can be indexed by search engines. With alt text, your customers can find your product through image search

Here are some tips on how to create good alt text:

:::tip

When choosing between writing good alt text to optimize your website or writing user-friendly alt text for people with visual impairments, always choose user-friendliness, inclusivity, and accessibility.

:::

- Describe the picture
- Do not forget to use your primary keywords in the description. Do not overload alt text with the keywords
- Keep it as concise as possible
- Do not use the word "image" in your alt text: a screen reader will automatically announce to the user that it is an image
- Take particular care if using emoji in your product descriptions. Screen readers will read out every character, so use emojis separately and do not use emojis with long names
- Avoid images with text: this text is inaccessible to screen readers and also prevents users from being able to zoom or customize the text to their needs. If you cannot avoid images of text, put the same text in the alt attribute
- End the description in the alt text with a period. In this case, the screen reader will make a short pause after the last word in the alt-text, so the user will be more comfortable listening to the information

:::info

If you leave the alt text field empty, the alt attribute will be "null", so neither search engines nor screen readers will be able to get any information about the image. 

:::

### Videos

At Unistore, we support embedded videos from YouTube, the most popular video marketing channel. Shoot your video, upload it on YouTube, and add a captivating description with the link to this product in your store. Monitor your video views directly on YouTube.

Product videos can:
- Answer the customer's questions about the product
- Reduce the number of support calls and product returns
- Increase the dwell time (amount of time user takes to analyze web page before clicking back to SERP)
- Build recognition of your brand
- Help to gain credibility and convince the potential customer of the value of your product
- Increase conversion rates
- Entertain your customers

Here are a few types of video you can use on your product pages:

- **Product presentation.** Shoot the video that demonstrates your product, its value, shows it in action, and highlights its key benefits and features
- **Unpacking.** People watch unpacking videos to actually see what the product looks like. When someone opens the product, customers can clearly see what they will get if they order the same product. A good way to promote your store is to find an influencer and ask them to shoot an unboxing video of your product. This video could be placed on YouTube and embedded on your product page
- **Overview of the product from an expert.** Ask an expert in your subject area to do a video review of your product
- **Instructions for use**. Place a short video with instructions for use if the product is complex

A few tips on product videos:

- Keep your videos short (30-120 seconds is the best length)
- Put your brand logo on the video
- Add captions to make your video more accessible
- Use soft instrumental music to enhance your video
- Put a call to action at the end of the video to show customers the next step to purchase

## SEO-friendly URLs

You deal with the composing URLs when creating a product or collection. A link is automatically generated from the product name (or collection title) with hyphens instead of spaces. You can leave them as they are or modify them so that the links are SEO-friendlier.

If you worked out the SEO-friendly URLs, it shows to search engines that you respect your visitors and think about their comfort.

Search engines appreciate this factor, so websites with SEO-friendly URLs are ranked above the rest.

:::info

To simplify your work, we have made editable only the "slug" of the link—the part where you need to specify the name of the product or collection.

:::

SEO-friendly URLs contain [keywords](#keywords) and are:

- informative
- easy-to-read
- memorable
- short

We recommend you to use our tips on how to compose your SEO-friendly URLs better:

**Informativity.** The link should let a customer understand what kind of product they will find on this page, and how is this product different from other similar products.

:::tip

For example, "t-shirt1" and "t-shirt2" in URL slugs give your customers no idea of the difference between these products.

:::

**Short and precise.**
Make links to your products and collections as short and clear as possible. The easier it is to understand the URL structure of your content, the more SEO-friendly it will be.

:::tip 

If you do not want the URL to look like a fragment of a phrase in the search results, try to keep full link under 80 characters. Search engines do not care how long a URL is, but users are more comfortable with the short ones.

:::

**Keywords.** In search engine results, keywords included in URLs are visible to users and help them understand that the website's content answers their query. This increases click-through rates and drives more traffic to the website. It is important to remember to focus on one or two keywords when creating a URL. If the URLs are overcrowded by the keywords, your website may rank worse.

<!-- ## Social sharing buttons

The sharing behavior of your website visitors may help you get more traffic and raise your brand recognition.

### What are social sharing buttons?

Social sharing buttons or social buttons are clickable icons displayed on the product web pages to allow your website visitors to share your content with their personal social networking profiles, such as Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook. 

<!-- уточнить этот список. Где твиттер? электронная почта? -->

<!-- It may look easy to copy the link of your website link, then go to social network and share this link. But consider the best benefit of having a social media buttons pack for sharing your web page content: your store visitors won’t have to leave your page just to post your content on their walls.

Remember that website users have short attention spans. So, keeping them engaged on your site is critical – ensure that you do not give them too many steps when they want to share your content. So, make sure that your web page is user-friendly as much as possible by having social sharing buttons easily accessible on the page.
When you make it easy for your readers to share your content, they are more likely to share your content with their social networks, driving more referral traffic to your site. -->

<!-- ### How do social sharing buttons impact on SEO?

Social sharing buttons are one of the types of social proof, which is an important factor for search ranking.

Social proof is the attempt to build credibility and trust towards your business by showcasing what others think of it. It relies on psychology and how people enjoy being part of a social group of like-minded people, which eventually may affect their purchasing decisions and their online behavior. -->

<!-- other could be customers reviews, SME opinion, influencer opinion (both opinions could be used in the added to the product video) -->

<!-- Displaying social share buttons on product pages benefits SEO in two important ways:

- Inciting and making it easy for customers to share product pages allows you to gain more traffic to the website. As this content is repeatedly shared on social media, the effect expands.
- As more and more people come to your website, there are more opportunities for natural links as these people mention and link to your products on their social networks.

Sharing links to your products helps increase your brand recognition and sends signals to search engines that your content is insightful. -->

<!-- ### Show social sharing buttons

To turn on showing of the sharing buttons:
1. In admin interface, go to **Website editor**
2. Select **Page editor**
3. In the dropdown menu, select **Product page**
4. Select **Product settings**
5. Mark the checkbox for **Show sharing buttons**
6. Select **Save** in the upper-right corner to apply changes  -->
