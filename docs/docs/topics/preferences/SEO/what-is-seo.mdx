SEO stands for search engine optimization and means a set of measures to increase the visibility of the website in search engines (such as, for example, Google or Bing) for targeted search queries related to your business. Which measures to apply depends on the chosen SEO [strategy](#seo-strategies).

Why is it important to promote your website in the search engines? The most significant sources of traffic to your store are search engines, where people look for the products and the services.

Today, people do not always make it to the second [search engine results page](#search-engine-results-page) (SERP). With one quick glance, they check the suggested search results from the top to find out if they match their query, and then choose the right option. The higher a website's position in SERP, the more users visit it.
SEO helps bring your store's website higher in the search results. 

## Search engine results page

A search engine results page is a web page of search results that a search engine displays in response to a user's query.

SERP may consist of:

- Paid search results (ad block)
- Additional features related to snippet optimization in search. For example, product reviews and prices
- Organic (unpaid) search results
- Search results for [images](on-page-seo.mdx#images) and [videos](on-page-seo.mdx#videos), which allows you to get additional traffic
- Related search results ([keywords](on-page-seo.mdx#keywords) and phrases similar to the user's query)


## Organic and inorganic search results

### Organic search results
*Organic search results* is the term for search engine results that are generated naturally (by relevance to the query) and do not depend on a commercial relationship between an organization and a search provider, Internet service provider, or other party that places search results. Search engines analyze relevancy to a search query depending on the presence and quantity of keywords on the page, quality and completeness of the information, and other characteristics.

The main goal of SEO is to raise the website higher in the SERPs among the organic search results.

### Inorganic search results
Inorganic or paid search advertising (also known as search engine marketingâ€”SEM) is a type of marketing that displays paid ads at the top of the SERPs. These inorganic search results often look like organic results, but contain a note that it is a commercial offer.

SEM focuses on using SEO and paid strategies, such as pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, to attract more organic and paid traffic to your site.

### What to use: SEO or SEM?

#### Goal
It is essential to be strategic in setting your priorities. If you want to get traffic quickly, whether it is to promote a sale, try out a new offer, or just increase the visibility of your site, then SEM is the way to go.

SEO, on the other hand, takes longer to get results, but it is good for long-term growth and increasing value.

#### Time
Time is an important factor when comparing SEO and SEM. You can get traffic from SEM almost immediately. But you should remember that once the ad campaign stops, the number of visits to your store's website is likely to decrease.

In contrast, you should not expect quick results from SEO. It takes time for a strategy to start producing results. But if you use SEO in the long-term with the right strategy, your web pages can stay at the top of search results for years, still generating revenue with minimal effort.

#### Money
If you use SEM, you pay every time someone clicks on the paid search result. You should include the pay-per-click in your SEM budget.
But if it is limited or your product margins are low, it may not make sense to do SEM. 

SEO requires more time investments than financial ones. When a user clicks on an organic result, no fee is charged.

## SEO strategies

SEO strategies are usually categorized into three types: On-Page, Off-Page, and Technical SEO.

*On-Page SEO* focuses on improving those aspects of your website that are under your control. It creates an optimized, keyword-focused website to attract the attention of search engines and users. This uses keyword research, image and content optimization, meta tags.

*Off-page SEO* aims to increase the authority and credibility of a website through making high-quality content and getting links to your website from other resources.

*Technical SEO* is not about content. It has to do with issues such as speed, indexing, UX, data structure, security, and mobile-friendliness of your website.
