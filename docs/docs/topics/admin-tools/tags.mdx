Tags are the additional marks you can assign to your products and customers. 
<!-- You can use tags to organize these items for better searching and filtering. -->
<!-- Tags for orders and transfers (?) (ECOM-204) -->
<!-- Automatic collection creating with product tags (ECOM-204) -->

Tags serve only for your store management, they are not visible on your store website. 

Product tags and customer tags are separate sets. They do not overlap, so you cannot access the product tags while creating or editing a customer, and vice versa. Your store can have up to 1 000 tags for each set. 

You can only interact with tags when creating and editing a [product](../products/products.mdx) or a [customer](../customers/customers.mdx).

:::note 

You need to save a product or a customer to apply all tag changes.

1. In **Tags**, fill in the tag name. You can use Latin letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores for the tag name. The tag name can have up to 255 symbols and must be unique within your store
