A gallery is a storage that contains media files. It allows you to upload media files that you can add to [products](../products/products.mdx), [collections](../products/collections/collections.mdx), or [website sections](../website-editor/page-editor/sections.mdx). 

First, you have to upload a media file to a gallery; then you can add the media to a product, a collection, or a website section.

:::info

A gallery exists as long as a product or a section. When you delete a product, a collection, or a section, you also delete its gallery and all media.

:::

There are two types of galleries: product galleries and shared gallery for collections and website galleries.

## Product gallery {#product-gallery}

Each product has its separate gallery. The product galleries do not overlap or connect. If you upload a file to a product gallery, this file will not be available in another product gallery. 

The product gallery files are also available for the product variants.

You can open a gallery for a product when you [create](../products/products.mdx#create-product), [edit it](../products/products.mdx#edit-product) or its [variants](../products/products.mdx#options-and-variants).

To open a product gallery, in the **Media** section, select **Select media**. The product gallery appears in the sidebar with **Images** and **Video** tabs.

You can upload up to 100 images and add one video link for a product gallery.

## Shared gallery {#shared-gallery}

Collections and website sections have one shared gallery. If you upload a file to the shared gallery, you can add this file image to any website section or collection.

To open the shared gallery, select **Image gallery** in the section settings sidebar or when creating or editing a collection. The shared gallery appears in the sidebar. 

<!-- You can upload up to 20 images for the website gallery. -->

## Gallery media {#gallery-media}

### Upload media {#upload-media}

A media uploaded to a gallery does not apply automatically to a product, a collection, or a website section. You [need to add it](#add-gallery-media).

To upload an image file:
1. Open the **Gallery** sidebar for a [product](#product-gallery) or [shared](#shared-gallery) gallery
2. In **Images** tab (for a product gallery), select <Image src="/img/upload-icon.png" alt="Upload media file icon" height={20} />
3. Choose the image file in the file explorer

After uploading an image file, its preview appears in the **Images** tab of the **Gallery** sidebar.

<!-- При этом при удалении в галерее вебсайта по идее должен работать мультиселект. Непонятно, как будет при добавлении -->
:::

To add an image from the gallery:
1. Open the **Gallery** sidebar for a [product](#product-gallery) or [shared](#shared-gallery) gallery
2. In the **Images** tab (for a product gallery), select the images you want to add. Make sure that the chosen images are highlighted
3. Select **Save**

<!--  It still doesn't work properly -->
To add a video from the gallery to a product:
1. In the product settings, open the **Gallery** sidebar
2. In the **Video** tab, make sure you have a link and select **Save**

When adding a gallery media to a product, you should consider the cases:
* The product does not have variants. In this case, the [product page](../website-editor/page-editor/page-editor.mdx#page-types) on your store website displays product media
* The product has variants. In this case, if the product variant is selected on the product page, it displays the variant media. If the variant does not have any media, the product page displays the product media. The product placeholder in the default theme [**Grid products**](../website-editor/page-editor/optimum.mdx#grid-products), [**Grid collection**](../website-editor/page-editor/optimum.mdx#grid-collection), and [**Display collection**](../website-editor/page-editor/optimum.mdx#display-collection) sections always displays the first <u>product</u> media

* The product has variants. In this case, if the product variant is selected on the product page, it displays the variant media. If the variant does not have any media, the product page displays the product media. The product placeholder in the default theme [**Grid products**](../website-editor/page-editor/optimum.mdx#grid-products), [**Grid collection**](../website-editor/page-editor/optimum.mdx#grid-collection), and [**Display collection**](../website-editor/page-editor/optimum.mdx#display-collection) sections always displays the first <u>product</u> media

### Remove gallery media {#remove-gallery-media}

:::

To remove an image or a video:
