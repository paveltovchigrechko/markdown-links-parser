The **Sales** report contains the records of all sales in your store. A sale is a single transaction for one position (also known as a line item) in an order. Transactions for shipping and refunds are counted as separate sales. 

For example, an order has three line items and a shipping charge. In this case, the **Sales** report displays four records for this order: a record for each line item (three in total) and a record for shipping. If you refund one line item to a customer, another record for the refund is added to the report.

<!-- The actuality of the data. When a merchant opens the report how actual is the report? See Shopify remarks (https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports/report-types/sales-report) -->

:::note

Orders with [payment statuses](../orders/orders.mdx#payment-status) *Pending* and *Canceled* do not have any sales yet, as well as draft orders. Thus, the **Sales** report contains the records for actual sales only.

<!-- Sales currency: always in USD. The conversion on the date of sale? -->

The table below describes the properties of **Sales** report records.
