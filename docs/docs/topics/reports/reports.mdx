A report is a set of records on your store's performance. Each report focuses on different metrics of your store. You can [explore report records](#report-records) to keep tracking the sales dynamics, study your customers' preferences and behavior, analyze the store transactions, and so on. 

You can also [export a report](#export-reports) as a CSV file for further analysis.
<!-- Further work with csv file for analysis -->
<!-- Connection with dashboard? There will be later -->

Your store comes with default reports provided by Unistore. 

| Report             |          Description         |
| :----------------: |:----------------------------:|
| [Sales](sales.mdx) | A report on your store sales |

Each report has a name, a category, and an author. A category is a type of store information shown in the report. An author is the report creator. All default reports have Unistore as an author.

## Report records {#report-records}

<!-- Shopify. Total amount: for all column data of just for the visible one? No total ATM -->
<!-- Shopify. Loading the data (> 1000 lines). No limits -->
Each report is a table of values where a line represents a single record. To browse the records, select the report you want to display the records for.

You can sort and filter report records. The available sorting and filtering methods depend on the report.

To sort the records, select <Image src="/img/sort-button.png" alt="Sort by" height={20} /> and select the sorting method.
<!-- Sorting by columns? No. -->
To filter the records, select <Image src="/img/filter-button.png" alt="Filter button" height={20} /> and choose the filtering criteria.

:::info

If you apply non-default sorting or filter, the corresponding button has the indication: <Image src="/img/non-default-sort-icon.png" alt="Non-default sort icon" width={20} height={20} />

## Export reports {#export-records}

When you export a report, you get a CSV (comma-separated values) file that you can use for further analysis.

:::caution

Unless you export the preselected records, the exported file contains the records that match the applied filter. The records order follows the report sorting.

:::

To export a report:
1. In **Reports**, select the report from which you want to export the records from
2. If you want to export manually preselected records only, mark the records using the checkboxes on the left side of the lines

:::tip

Mark the highest checkbox to select all records at once.

:::

3. Select **Export**
4. In the pop-up window, select one of the options for the report export:
      1. All records: the export file will contain all report records
      2. Current page: the export file will contain only the records listed on the current page in **Reports**
      3. Selected records: the export file will contain only the records with previously marked checkboxes 
      4. All records within the period. If you choose this option, the calendar field for the period date appears:
          * Select the calendar field
          * In the calendar, select the first day of the period
          * Select the last day of the period. Select the same day if you want the period to include only one day

:::tip

The calendar highlights the selected period.
