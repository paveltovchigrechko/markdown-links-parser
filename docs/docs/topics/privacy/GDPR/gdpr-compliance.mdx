Unistore provides you with the tools to comply with GDPR:
- All registered customers can access their [personal accounts](../../customers/personal-account.mdx) and edit their data
- Customers can request [a copy of their data or demand the permanent deletion of their personal information](../../customers/customers.mdx#customer-data) (anonymization) retained in your store
- You can use the consent checkbox on the customer [registration](../../customers/customers.mdx) page to get their permission to process personal data

:::caution

As a merchant, you are required to obtain the customer's consent for data processing, so we strongly recommend that you do not remove the consent checkbox from the registration page.

- Using [custom pages](../../custom-pages/custom-pages.mdx), you can create your privacy policy to clearly and transparently inform how you collect, use, store, and share personal data. Make sure it covers all the necessary information required by the GDPR, such as the purposes of processing, data retention periods, and individual rights. Specify how the customer can contact you if they want to anonymize their data or obtain a file containing the information collected about them
<!-- You can import information about customer into CSV file to make this data portable -->
