The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a data protection law that was implemented in the European Union (EU) on May 25, 2018. Its main purpose is to protect the personal data and privacy rights of individuals in the EU. 

Here are the main principles of the GDPR:

- Personal data must be processed in a legal, fair, and transparent way. Individuals must be informed about how their data is collected, used, and shared

- The collection of personal information must be for specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes. It should not be further processed in a way that is incompatible with those purposes

- Personal information that is collected must be limited to what is necessary for the intended purpose. Organizations should collect the minimum data necessary to achieve these purposes

- Personal information must be accurate and kept up to date. Inaccurate or incomplete data must be corrected or deleted

- Personal information must not be kept longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. When it is no longer needed, it should be securely deleted or anonymized

- Organizations must take appropriate security actions to protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, change, or deletion. Data must be processed in a manner that ensures its security and confidentiality

- It is the responsibility of organizations to demonstrate their compliance with the principles of the GDPR. They must keep records of their data processing activities, perform privacy impact analyses where required, and appoint a privacy officer in certain cases

- There must be a lawful basis for processing personal data. The GDPR provides several legal bases, including the individual's consent, the necessity of processing for the performance of a contract, compliance with a legal requirements, and the protection of vital interests

- The GDPR grants individuals certain rights in relation to their personal data. These are the right to access their data, correct mistakes, delete data ("right to be forgotten"), restrict processing, transfer data, object to processing, and not be subject to automated decision making

- The GDPR restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU that do not provide an appropriate level of data protection. Organizations must use standard contractual terms or binding corporate rules to provide for the protection of personal data when it is transferred internationally
