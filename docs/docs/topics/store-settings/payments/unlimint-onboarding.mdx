## Contact information

:::info

This step is only for companies and partnerships.

:::

In this step, you need to add contact persons to deal with various issues related to your store.

There are two types of contact persons, who you can add at this step:
- Physical individual
- Legal entity

### Roles
There are seven roles for different types of issues your contact persons may deal with:

**Director**. The director is the head of the company who is also the **Signatory**. 

**Signatory**. A person who is not a director but who has the authority to sign documents.

**Operational lead**. The main contact, the one who makes the decisions. They receive data from the product environment in their mailbox.

**Technical lead**. The person responsible for integration and technical issues. They receive the data from the sandbox (test environment) in their mailbox.

**Dispute and fraud advisor**. The contact person who may be contacted about fraud attacks or with recommendations for analyzing transactions over a period of time to check for fraud. There may also be questions about chargebacks received and providing documents if required by the schemes.

**Beneficial owner**. The company owner.

**Shareholder**. A shareholder is a person or company that owns at least one share of a company's stock.


Six of these roles are obligatory for the contact persons you are adding. The role of **Shareholder** is optional.

Contact persons of the "legal entity" type can only be added for the **Director** and **Shareholder** roles.
