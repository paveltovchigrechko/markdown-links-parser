All Unistore themes support multiple languages for the store website. You can enable different languages on your website to provide your customers the content in their native language.

When a customer comes to your store website, the website checks the language settings of the customer's browser. If the website has the same language it displays the content in that language. Otherwise, the website uses the [default language](#set-language-as-default).

To start working with languages:
<Tabs
  groupId="view-mode"
  defaultValue="desktop"
  values={[
    {label: 'Desktop', value: 'desktop'},
    {label: 'Tablet', value: 'tablet'},
    {label: 'Mobile', value: 'mobile'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="desktop">

1. In admin interface, select **Settings**
2. In the sidebar, select **Languages**

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="tablet">

1. In admin interface, select <Image src="/img/hamburger-menu-button.png" alt="Menu button" width={20} height={20} />
2. In the sidebar, select **Settings**, then **Languages**

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mobile">

1. In admin interface, select <Image src="/img/hamburger-menu-button.png" alt="Menu button" width={20} height={20} />
2. In the sidebar, select **Settings**, then **Languages**

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In **Languages**, you can:
* [Add a language](#add-language)
* [Edit a language translations](#edit-language-translations)
* [Publish](#publish-language) and [unpublish](#unpublish-language) a language
* [Set a language as default](#set-language-as-default) for your store website
* [Delete a language](#delete-language)

## Add language {#add-language}

:::info

You can add a language only if the current website theme supports multiple languages and it has languages that were not added yet. You can check the current theme in **[Theme library](../../themes/themes.mdx)**.

<!-- Set of possible languages -->

## Edit language translations {#edit-language-translations}

The **Edit language** contains fields with the texts to be translated. The fields for translations are grouped by tabs. Each tab represents the corresponding website content. If you edit a non-default language, the page provides the default language translations as a reference.

:::info

The language translations can contain Liquid variables in double curly brackets:
```
{{ variable_name }}
```
Usually, Liquid variables represent digits or texts that should not be translated (for example, customers names). We recommend you not to translate or delete Liquid variables.

3. Select **Save**

If at least one translation field is empty, a pop-up window with the corresponding message appears. Select **Confirm** to save the language and leave the page. You can also cancel and use the [filter to show empty fields](#filter-language-translations).
