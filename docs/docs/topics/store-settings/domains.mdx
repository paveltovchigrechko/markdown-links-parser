A domain (that is domain name) is a web address that people use to reach a website.
A domain that people use to reach your store at Unistore is called an active domain. 
The active domain is at the top of the list in the green line.

:::info

By default, you have the Unistore domain connected and active.

:::

The default address of your store has the following look: `storename.yourunistore.com`.

You can use it or add your own domain. 

:::tip

If you add your own domain for the store, you may also want to use it for your store's outgoing mail. Learn how to [change your store's outgoing email](outgoing-email.mdx).

:::

In Unistore, you can add up to 10 domains. They may have different [statuses](#domain-statuses) but only one domain could be active at a time. You can find all the added domains in the **Idle** list. 

## Domain statuses
There are three statuses the added domain can be in the **Idle** list:

**Connecting**. You changed the DNS settings on your domain provider's website. We need some time to verify your domain. This can take up to 48 hours. 

**Connected**. The domain verification was successful. The domain is connected and can be turned active. People visiting all your domains in this status will be redirected to the active domain.

**Not connected**. The domain is unavailable or there is something wrong with the **A record** you changed in the DNS settings on your provider's website: it either does not exist or is incorrect.

In **Status updated** column, you can find the date when the status of the connection was updated.

## Add domain

:::info Before you start

 Before adding new domain to your store, you need to log in to your account on the domain providerâ€™s website. In DNS settings, replace or create following data:
- First **A record** with subdomain **@** and the Unlimit address, specified in **Add domain** pop-up
- Second **A record** with subdomain **www** and the Unlimit address, specified in **Add domain** pop-up

Save settings and go back to your admin interface at Unistore.

1. In the admin interface, go to **Store settings** > **Domain**
2. Select **Add Domain**
3. Fill in **Domain name**

## Make domain active / idle

:::tip

Only domains in *Connected* status can be turned active.

:::

:::info

If you have one of the added domains active and you move it to the **Idle** list, the default Unistore domain becomes active automatically. If an added active domain becomes unavailable, the default domain becomes active.

:::

Steps:


1. In the admin interface, go to **Store settings** > **Domain**
2. Turn <Image src="/img/toggle.png" alt="Toggle icon" height={20} /> on to make domain active or turn <Image src="/img/toggle-off.png" alt="Toggle icon" height={20} /> off to put the domain to the **Idle** list

:::info

The default domain cannot be manually put to the **Idle** list. The default domain is automatically moved to it if you make any of the added domains active.
