As a merchant, you might need to charge value-added taxes (VAT) for the [products](../products/products.mdx) you sell. The VAT for your products can depend on your store business address, local tax laws, and the type of products.

Unistore provides you with the default VAT rates for the most countries. You can use standard VAT rates or set up an alternative tax in case of a non-standard tax situation (for example, if the product you sell has a non-standard VAT).

You can apply VAT based on your customers' country only. If you enable VAT calculations in your store, Unistore calculates VAT rates for your products depending on the customer's country and adds them to the product prices. That means your online store shows the original prices without VAT, and the total price is shown to your customers at the checkout. 

:::caution

Unistore **does not** report or pay your taxes to your local authorities. It provides you with the instruments to make the calculations and the process easier. 

The **Taxes** section allows you to set up the VAT only. If you have to pay any other type of taxes, you should calculate and handle these payments by yourself.

## Steps for setting up taxes {#setup}

1. Set up [delivery options](delivery-options.mdx) for the regions and countries where you sell and ship your products
2. [Set up the VAT rates](#set-country-vat) for the countries where you sell and ship your products
3. [Change the alternative taxes](#alternative-tax) for the products or countries where necessary

## Taxes section {#taxes-section}

In **Taxes**, you can:
* [enable and disable](#vat) VAT calculation
* [set](#set-country-vat) the country VAT
* [add](#add-alternative-tax), [edit](#edit-alternative-tax), and [delete](#delete-alternative-tax) alternative tax for the products in a collection

* **Alternative taxes**. This parameter indicates if you have set [alternative taxes](#alternative-tax) for the country. By default, the parameter has the value **No** for all countries

##  Enable and disable VAT charging {#vat}

:::caution

Before enabling VAT charging, make sure the rates are correct for your particular business and products. We strongly recommend you consult with the local tax authority or a tax accountant.

:::

Note that you cannot enable or disable the VAT charging for a particular country. In such a case, you can [edit the VAT](#set-country-vat) for that country.

After you enable VAT charging:

## Set country VAT {#set-country-vat}

You can set the VAT rate for a country:
1. In **Taxes**, select the country you want to change VAT for
2. In **Country tax**, specify the new percentage value for VAT or select <Image src="/img/update-button.png" alt="Restore button" width={20} height={20} /> to set the default VAT rate for the country
3. Select **Save**

:::tip

You can set the VAT value to 0 if you do not want to charge VAT in this particular country.

:::

In **Taxes**, you can check the updated **Rate** value for the country. 

## Alternative tax {#alternative-tax}

An alternative tax is a non-standard VAT applied to the products from a specific collection. So when you enable VAT for your store, the customers from a particular country pay the standard country VAT for all products except for the products from the collection with alternative tax.

:::info 

If a product is included in two or more collections with an alternative tax, the VAT for this product is calculated using the alternative tax for the last collection which was set up.

:::

Note that the alternative tax is applied for a collection in a specific country only. If you need to apply alternative tax for a collection in different countries, you have to set alternative tax for each country.

Before applying alternative tax, you should [create collections](../products/collections/collections.mdx#create-collection) for products that have non-standard VAT in the country. 

### Add alternative tax {#add-alternative-tax}

To add an alternative tax:
1. In **Taxes**, select the country you want to add an alternative tax to
2. In **Alternative taxes** block, select **Add**

4. In **Alternative tax**, specify the non-standard VAT in percents for the products in the chosen collection
5. Select **Save**. In **Alternative taxes** block, you can check the collection and the alternative tax for it

:::info

If the collection has a product that is included in another collection with an alternative tax, a pop-up window appears. Select **Continue** to apply the current collection alternative tax to the product.

:::

After you add the first alternative tax, in the **Taxes** section, the parameter **Alternative taxes** for the country should have the value **Yes**.
