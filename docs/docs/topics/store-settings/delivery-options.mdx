Delivery options are the delivery terms under which [customers](../customers/customers.mdx) receive their purchases. Delivery options are created for a specific [region](#create-region) and may have exceptions to the basic conditions ([delivery rules](#add-delivery-rule)). 

:::info

When you create a store, simultaneously a domestic region with your country is created.
The country is defined by the IP-address under which you logged in to Unistore to create your store.

:::

You can [edit existing region](#edit-region) by adding new countires to it, or you can [create a new region](#create-region). In any of this cases, you need to [add delivery options](#add-delivery-option) to any of your regions.

:::danger Warning

If no delivery option is created in a region, no delivery is available to it. Customers from such regions will be unable to complete the checkout.
