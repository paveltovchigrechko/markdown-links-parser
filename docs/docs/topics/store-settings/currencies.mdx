:::tip

If you are creating a new store in Unistore from scratch rather than migrating it, create all the products first and then add the necessary currencies. Prices in the new currencies will be automatically recalculated using [Open exchange rates](https://openexchangerates.org/).

If you create currencies first and then add products, you will have to specify prices in all currencies manually when creating new products.

:::

<!-- If you are an experienced seller who is migrating your store from one e-commerce platform to another, firstly import your product data from old platform to a CSV file. After that, on the new platform, add all currencies in which you have prices. After that, you can make export of your CSV file. Otherwise, you will need to manually specify product prices in additional currencies. -->

By default, prices are calculated in US dollars. You can add regions with different currencies, so that customers from those countries can have prices for the products in their own currencies.

The customer's region is determined by the language set in the browser that the customer uses to visit your store.
