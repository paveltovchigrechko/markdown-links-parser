The *Archived* status is used for products that are not currently available for sale, but can be sold in the future.

:::info

Products with this status are displayed only in the admin interface in the list of products when the *Archived* filter is selected.

## Product parameters

### Description
**Product name**.
Product name is the title of the product, as it is presented to your customers. 

:::note

The product name must be unique within the store.

:::

**SKU**.
SKU (stock keeping unit)—a unique identification number of goods within the store. 

:::tip

You can enter the SKU manually in the input field or generate it automatically by selecting <Image src="/img/generate-sku-button.png" alt="Generate SKU" height={22} /> in the field.

:::

**Barcode, ISBN, UPC, GTIN, etc.**
If your product has a Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), barcode, ISBN or UPS, you can enter that number in the input field.

**Description**.

:::tip

You can use the format bar to highlight in the description important things for the customer.

:::

Describe the product for the customer in as much detail as possible: its functions, features, and details. In this way, your customer's expectations are more likely to match reality, so they will be satisfied and you will have less product returns.

:::info

Explore [article](../preferences/SEO/on-page-seo.mdx#how-to-write-product-descriptions) to find a few recommendations on how to write strong product descriptions.

:::

If your product is not original, but a copy of the brand, this must be stated in the product description.


:::danger WARNING

We can delete products that do not match the description. If there are many such products, we may completely delete the entire store. Please, be honest with your customers.

:::

### Management
<!-- на тесте и стейдже это organization, но мы с Ваней договорились поменять -->
**Theme template**.
At the moment, there is only a default template. It is not available to change it.

**Vendor**.
You can specify a vendor for each product. In the future, you can make your search for products easier by using a filter by vendor name. Explore [full article](vendors/vendors.mdx) for more detailed information.

**Collection**.
You can create product collections to help customers easily find the products they're interested in or highlight the store's special offers. Explore [full article](collections/collections.mdx) for more detailed information.

**Tags**.
Tag products to organize them, simplify the search for your customers and create the best recommendations for the related products.
You can use up to 250 tags for one product.
Explore [full article](../admin-tools/tags.mdx) for more detailed information.

### Tracking
When creating a product, mark the **Track inventory** checkbox to keep track of product stock in the store.

:::tip

**Keep selling product if out of stock**. You can mark this checkbox if you expect this product to arrive in stock soon or if the actual quantity of the product in your stock does not match the quantity in the Unistore stock.

:::

### Pricing
In the **Pricing** block, specify the cost of the product. If you trade using multiple currencies, set the price in all of them.
You can add or remove [currencies](../store-settings/currencies.mdx) in the **Settings**. By default, all prices are calculated in US dollars.

:::note

The **Price** field is required if you select the *Active* product status.

:::

In the **Comparative price** field, enter the price of the product without discounts, special offers, or promotions. Due to the presence of a comparative price, your customers understand the benefits of buying that particular product. The **Comparative price** field is optional.

### Media

:::tip

Check our [Media optimization article](../preferences/SEO/on-page-seo.mdx#media-optimization) to learn more about it.

:::

Images serve to draw the customer's attention to the product and give a better sense of it. 

:::tip

Images show details to the customer: how the product works, what its color, size, and quality are.

:::

Use YouTube links to add product reviews to the description. You can add to product up to 5 images and up to 1 YouTube link.

All the uploaded images and added links are presented in the list under the upload files button. 
Explore [full article](../admin-tools/media-gallery.mdx) for more detailed information.

<!--  
## Weight -->

<!--  Specify the weight of the product to correctly calculate shipping costs. If you select the _Digital_ product type, the **Weight** block is not displayed. -->

### SEO snippets

SEO stands for "Search Engine Optimization", which is a process of attracting users to your website through search queries.

:::tip

SEO can make your website more visible for the potential customers, which means more traffic and more possibilities for converting leads into customers.

:::

A snippet is a short description of a web page that appears on the search engine results page. It helps users better understand the content of the website and decide whether to choose it. Make the snippet more appealing by adding a page title, an attractive description, and quick link.

:::tip

Check our [What is SEO?](../preferences/SEO/what-is-seo.mdx) and [SEO basics](../preferences/SEO/on-page-seo.mdx) articles to learn more about it.

:::

By default, data in the **Title of search snippet** field is copied from the **Product name** field, data in the **Description of search snippet** field is copied from the **Description** field. The **URL** value is generated automatically.

:::note

All values are in the input fields, so you can change them.

:::

## Options and variants

If you sell many kinds of one product, you can add options and variants to it. Each option should have its variants.

### Options and variants listing
