A collection represents a group of products. For example, you can create a collection for:
* seasonal products
* products on sale
* products of a certain type (t-shirts, jeans)
* products for specific customer group (men, women, children)
* products that require specific taxes (find more in **[Taxes](../../store-settings/taxes.mdx)**)

Each collection has its page on your store website. In the [website editor](../../website-editor/website-editor.mdx), you can configure settings for [collection page](../../website-editor/page-editor/page-editor.mdx#page-types).

:::caution

You can have up to 1 000 collections within one store.
