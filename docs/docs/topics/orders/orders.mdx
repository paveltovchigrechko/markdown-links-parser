- Payment status
- Fulfillment status

### Order status

Order statuses are:
- Draft
- Active
- Archived

**Draft**. The [manually created](#create-order) order with at least one product added. Such orders with <Image src="/img/draft-status.png" alt="Draft status" height={22} /> label have not yet received the payment status, are not displayed in the statistics on the [dashboard](../dashboard/dashboard.mdx), are not reflected in the **[Sales](../reports/sales.mdx)** report, and could be [deleted completely from the store](#delete-order). *Draft* status can only be changed to *Active* after order is marked as *Paid*. It is not possible to change an order status back to *Draft*, or to archive orders in *Draft* status.

**Active**. An order that is in neither *Draft* nor *Archived* status. You can change order status from *Active* to *Archived* and back.

**Archived**. An order that has both payment status and fulfillment status, and which is hidden from the list of orders. Use the [filter](#filter-orders) by order status to display archived orders. You can change order status from *Active* to *Archived* and back. <!-- как именно мерчант будет архивировать заказы - пока не утверждено. В эпике описано одно, Ваня говорит, что точно должны быть балковые операции, но их нет на макетах. Допишу позже -->

### Payment status

You can change payment status of the order by performing the [actions](#actions) with the it.
