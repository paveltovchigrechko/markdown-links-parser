## What is abandoned cart?

A usual shopping cart is marked as abandoned 2 hours after the customer has moved on to the second step of the **Checkout** and has stopped performing any actions with this cart. This means that the abandoned cart always has the customer's email.

An information about a cart that has once been marked as abandoned will be stored in Unistore for an infinite amount of time, even if a customer returns to it and places an order.

After two hours of inactivity, customers will receive [an email](email-notifications/email-notifications.mdx#abandoned-cart) about availability of the products and an invitation to return to the shopping.

Statistics [show](https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate) that the average cart abandonment rate for desktops is just under 70%. For tablet and mobile, the abandonment rate is even higher than 80%.

This means that almost 7 out of 10 of your prospects will not complete their purchase in your store. The **Abandoned carts** section helps you to collect and analyze statistics on abandoned carts in your store, identify the main reasons users abandon carts, and work through these problems.

By using third-party mailing services, you can send out emails to customers who have these products in their abandoned carts to inform them about discounts, special offers, or availability of this products in your inventory.

:::info

:::

2. Select <Image src="/img/export-button.png" alt="Export" height={22} />

- all abandoned carts
- carts listed on the current page

- abandoned carts created within selected period (select **Date** field to define date or period)
4. Select **Export**
5. Select **Close**

The file will be saved in the file storage of your device.

## Cart types

There are two types of abandoned carts in the Unistore:

- Authorized customer abandoned cart
- Guest cart (marked as <Image src="/img/guest-cart.png" alt="Guest" height={22} /> on the [abandoned cart page](#abandoned-cart-page))

:::note

This type of abandoned cart exists in the store if not only registered users are [allowed](../store-settings/store-settings.mdx#set-up-main-store-settings) to place orders.

:::


The authorized customer abandoned cart is associated with the customer for an infinite amount of time, while the guest cart is associated with the customer only for the lifetime of the cookie file. After 14 days from the creation of the guest cart, the association to the guest customer disappears, but the cart is not deleted.

## Abandoned cart statuses
Each abandoned cart has two independent statuses: 
- Activity status
- Recovery status

### Activity status

You can hide abandoned carts you do not want to work with at the moment. 
By default, all abandoned carts have an *Active* status. After archiving, the cart gets the status *Archived* and is not displayed in the abandoned cart listing.

When the status is changed, the cart is not forever deleted, but only hidden from the list. 

The cart is automatically deleted in three cases:
- All the products in the cart have been removed
- You deleted from the store all products that customer have in their abandoned cart
- The guest logged in and already had a cart before. The authorized customer cart will be deleted, and the customer will have their current cart

On the abandoned cart page in the admin interface, all archived carts are displayed with the <Image src="/img/archived-status.png" alt="Archived" height={22} /> status.

:::info

Archiving an abandoned cart only affects the display of the abandoned cart in your list and has no impact on the actual display of the cart to the customer. Archiving is used for your comfort only.

:::

Use [filters](#filter-carts) to display only carts in a selected status.

#### Archive / unarchive cart {#archive-cart}

<Tabs
groupId="view-mode"

    {label: 'Desktop', value: 'desktop'},
    {label: 'Tablet', value: 'tablet'},
    {label: 'Mobile', value: 'mobile'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="desktop">

You can change *Activity status* in three different ways.

First way:

1. In the admin interface, go to **Marketing** → **Abandoned carts**
2. In the table, select <Image src="/img/archive-button.png" alt="Archive" height={20} /> or <Image src="/img/unarchive-button.png" alt="Unarchive" height={19} /> for the cart you want to change *Activity status* for

Second way:

1. In the admin interface, go to **Marketing** → **Abandoned carts**
2. Mark the checkbox of the cart you want to change *Activity status* for

### Recovery status

The status shows whether the customer has created an order from this cart. By default, all abandoned carts have the status <Image src="/img/not-recovered-status.png" alt="Not Recovered" height={22} />. 

If the customer returns to the cart and makes a purchase, the status automatically changes to <Image src="/img/recovered-status.png" alt="Recovered" height={22} />, however the abandoned cart is not removed from the list.

:::note

If an order created from a cart with *Recovered* status is removed, this abandoned cart remains in the list.

:::

You can hide it manually from the list by [changing its *Activity status*](#archive-cart). 

## Abandoned cart page

Using [filters](#filter-carts) and data [export](#export-carts), you can work with abandoned carts in bulk. To work with each page separately, select an abandoned cart from the list. Each of these pages represents a set of data left by the customer.

The completeness of the information that is displayed on the abandoned cart page depends on the step at which the customer abandoned their cart.

### Completeness of data and potential reasons for cart abandonment

To be able to analyze the reasons for cart abandonment, you need to know what data at each step is displayed to your potential customer, and what information they provide:

1. The first step is the **Cart**. This page contains the information about the cost, quantity and availability of the selected products.
2. The second step is **Shipping details** in the checkout. Here, the customer selects choices of shipping methods and their costs, and provides their shipping details.
3. The third step is **Payment** in the checkout. At this step, the prospect chooses a payment method and pays for the purchase.

The customer receives an information on the price and availability of the items from their cart in the **Cart** step, while the abandoned cart is created in the second or third step of the **Checkout**. This means that customers whose carts were abandoned had no problems with either the price or availability of the products.

If the registered customer abandoned their cart after proceeding to the second step of the **Checkout**, the reason may be the high delivery cost, the method of delivery inconvenient for the client, or no delivery to customer's address at all.

If the abandoned cart page contains the customer's personal details, shipping address, and selected delivery option, it means that the customer went through step two, but stopped at step three, **Payment**. The reason for abandoning the cart at that step may be the lack of a convenient method of payment for the customer or problems with the payment service.
