There are a number of situations when it is a good practice to communicate with your customers. For example, when they sign up or place orders in your online store. Your store comes with a set of default emails for this purpose. When a triggering event occurs the corresponding email is automatically sent to your customer. A triggering event can be a new sign-up for your store or a successful payment for an order. 

You cannot add or delete any of the default emails. Your customers always receive them in case of a triggering event. 

If you use Unistore domain for your store, your customers receive emails from <Code>no-reply@unistore.com</Code>.
<!-- You can change your store outgoing email for customers notification in [**Outgoing email**](../../store-settings/outgoing-email.mdx). -->

:::note

If a customer does not receive emails from you, we recommend asking them to check a spam folder in their email. If the problem continues, we recommend asking them to provide an alternative email address from a different email provider.
