You can customize an email in the email editor. To open the email editor, select an email in **[Email notifications](email-notifications.mdx)**. In the email editor you can:
* [Change email subject and content](#change-email)
* [Find tips for email customization](#tips)
* [Reset an email to the default](#reset)

## Change email subject and body {#change-email}

The email editor contains fields:
1. **Email subject**. It is an email title that can contain up to 200 symbols
2. **Email body**. It is HTML body that represents an email content

:::danger

You can leave the **Email body** blank. In this case, your customers will receive specific emails without content. This may make certain actions unavailable for your customers, for example, they will not receive a link to confirm their account in your store. We strongly recommend using the default email body. [Reset the email to the default](#reset) if you changed it accidentally. 

:::

The sidebar in the email editor contains all emails available for editing. You can switch between emails anytime.

:::tip

If you are in tablet or mobile view, the sidebar is hidden by default. Select <Image src="/img/hamburger-menu-button.png" alt="Menu button" width={20} height={20} /> to open the sidebar.

:::

To save the email changes, select **Save**.

:::info
<!-- Check if there is any delay -->
When you save an email, all changes apply immediately, and your customers start to receive the current email version.

:::

If you leave the editor or switch the email while having the unsaved changes, the pop-up window appears. 

:::tip

You can find general recommendations for email customization and recommendations for specific emails in [Email recommendations](email-recommendations.mdx).

Email title and body can contain Liquid variables. Check out [Email variables reference](email-notifications-variables-reference.mdx) to discover which objects and properties you can use in your store emails.
