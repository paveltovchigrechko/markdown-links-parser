import Code from "@site/src/components/Code";

Email notifications use Liquid to render their content. Liquid is a template language that provides a simple syntax to display the dynamic variables in emails. For example, using Liquid you can display a customer name, an order number, and its content in the email.

This article describes the Liquid objects and their properties you can use when editing an email body in [email editor](email-customizing.mdx):
* [order](#order) 
* [line item](#line-item)
* [transaction](#transaction)
* [customer](#customer)
* [address](#address)
* [shop](#shop)
* [abandoned checkout](#abandoned-checkout)
* [refund](#refund)
<!-- * [tax line](#tax-line) -->

:::info

You can set the basic email features for all emails at once using [email template customizing](template-customization.mdx). 

:::

A reference to an object in Liquid should be always enclosed in double curly braces: <Code>{{ customer.first_name }}</Code>. In this case, Liquid renders the <Code>first_name</Code> property of the <Code>customer</Code> object. 

## Order {#order}

The <Code>[order](../../orders/orders.mdx)</Code> object is available to use in the following emails:
* [Successful order payment](email-notifications.mdx#successful-order-payment)
* [Order refund](email-notifications.mdx#order-refund)
* [Order cancellation](email-notifications.mdx#order-cancellation)
<!-- Abandoned cart? -->
* [Order is in the delivery service](email-notifications.mdx#order-is-in-the-delivery-service)
* [Successful delivery](email-notifications.mdx#successful-delivery)

:::note

You should call the order object directly: use <Code>{{ property }}</Code> notation instead of <Code>{{ order.property }}</Code>.
