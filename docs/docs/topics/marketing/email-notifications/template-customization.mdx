While every email in **Email notifications** has unique content, they share the same style and design. Email template customization allows changing the style for all your store emails at once. 

In the email template editor, you can:
* [set a logo image or text](#logo)
* [change the color styles for email interactive elements](#styles) (such as buttons)

To customize the email template:

<Tabs
  groupId="view-mode"
  defaultValue="desktop"
  values={[
    {label: 'Desktop', value: 'desktop'},
    {label: 'Tablet', value: 'tablet'},
    {label: 'Mobile', value: 'mobile'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="desktop">

1. In store admin interface, go **Marketing** > **Email notifications**
2. In **Email notifications**, select **Customize template**

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="tablet">

1. In admin interface, select <Image src="/img/hamburger-menu-button.png" alt="Menu button" width={20} height={20} />
2. In the sidebar, select **Marketing**, then **Email notifications**
3. In **Email notifications**, select <Image src="/img/customize-email-template-button.png" alt="Customize email template button" height={20} />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mobile">
