## Metrics {#metrics}

* **Conversion rate** shows the percentage of the paid carts among all carts
* **Average order value** is the average income you receive for an order. It is always displayed in your store main [currency](../store-settings/currencies.mdx) and is calculated as total income from all orders divided by orders number
